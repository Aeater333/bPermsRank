bPermsRank
==========

bPermsRank was created as a simple plugin to work alongside bPermissions and allow easy group changing and group change notifications. This plugin uses the bPermissions built in API, but it adds a more user friendly feel to changing the group of a player. This plugin also allows a server admin to set permissions for each group so that different players can rank to different groups. This is similar to the bPermissions /promote command, but bPermsRank will provide you with more options and user friendly feedback if you make a mistake.
